Encoder/Decoder for WillowÂ² cipher

[cipher doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJ60Dl6miGq5QVKt6t3z53LavGkv63PqsVgBm_1ferM/edit?tab=t.0)
I found this really cool cipher made by @willowneon on discord and I decided to make a encoder/decoder

# To Fix
- [ ] encoder output is a little bit messy
- [ ] handle errors more gracefully
- [ ] do some optimizations 

# How to run it

```
git clone https://github.com/barbocaster/willow2cipher.git
cd willow2cipher/src
python3 willow.py
```
